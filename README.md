# Pico Playground
When i started with pico there were a few different things i wanted to learn through it and understanding how to set it up was a bit scattered and confusing at first. so I created this repo beased on some templates out there to get started with the environment , more specifically build systems and examples for me to keep working on.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/furhadjidda/embedded_software_pico_playground.git`.
2. Enter the repo: `cd embedded_software_pico_playground`.
3. Install the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
4. Optionally, manually configure the build process: `cmake -S . -B build/`.
5. Optionally, manually build the app: `cmake --build build`.
6. Connect your device so itâ€™s ready for file transfer.
